# TreasureIslandGame
This is a simple game which asks the user to make one of three choices to progress through the game.
This is used with nested if statements, incorrect answers would lose the game, correct answers would have you progress and win the treasure at the end of the game.

Very simple, but was a great learning experience with nested if statements.
