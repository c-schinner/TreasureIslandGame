# Treasure Island Adventure
Welcome to Treasure Island, an interactive text-based adventure game! Your mission is to find the hidden treasure on the mysterious island. Are you ready to embark on this exciting journey?

# Introduction
You awaken in an unfamiliar place after surviving a storm that wrecked your boat. You find yourself in an empty room with two doors ahead, both seemingly leading outside.

# Gameplay Instructions
At the beginning of your journey, you must decide which door to choose: the door on the left or the door on the right.
Depending on your choice, you will face a series of decisions that will shape your adventure and determine your fate.
Read the prompts carefully and type your responses as instructed (e.g., "left" or "right").
Explore the island, make choices, and discover the outcome of your decisions.

# Gameplay Scenario
# Door Choice
You start by choosing a door:

If you choose the door on the left, you venture into the palm tree forest.
If you choose the door on the right, you cross a bridge over a river.

# Path Choices
Forest Path (Left Door): You might encounter challenges and decisions that lead you deeper into the forest. Choose wisely!
Bridge Crossing (Right Door): Your choice here might determine the direction of your journey, whether toward a mountain or a clearing.

# Mountain Path
If you chose to go straight, you'll find yourself inside a cave within the mountain.
Inside the cave, you will encounter three doors: one to the left, one straight ahead, and one to the right.

# Treasure Found
If you choose the door on the right inside the cave, congratulations! You've found the hidden treasure.
Your task now is to make your way back to safety with the treasure.

# Other Choices
Choosing the other doors might lead to unfortunate consequences, so be cautious with your decisions.

# Clearing Path
If you chose to go to the right after crossing the bridge, you'll enter a clearing.
Unfortunately, the clearing doesn't offer protection from the island's dangers.

# Forest Path Dangers
If you chose to go left into the forest, you might encounter a tribe of natives who have been hunting you.
If captured by the natives, your fate won't be pleasant.

# Endings
Successfully finding the treasure and escaping the island leads to a victorious outcome.
Making unfortunate decisions can lead to unfavorable endings.
